         <p style="color:magenta;font-size:20px;">Hello,

My name is Kevin Nguyen and I am currently an 

economics major looking to change to BFA digital

media art. Originally I always intended to pursue 

art as a career and that is mainly in the lecturer

field and that is my dream. I always wanted to 

become an art lecturer and because of such want a

BFA in diglital media art would allow me to reach that 

kind of goal. Please understand that this is

something I always wanted but it takes quite some 

time for me to figure out my career path. I am an 

older generation student and is looking for a last

minute change of plan and that is to pursue a degree

in art. I am a hard worker and is looking to change 

my career for the better in order to pursue a future

plan. This is a last minute change up but the 

reason being is because I was immature in my 

beginning of college career and did not fully make

up my mind in order to choose which major. Also I am 

currently taking many art classes and have done so

in the past in order to fulfill my dream of becoming

an artist and a college lecturer. My grades and GPA

has been an upward trend in the art field and thus I

truly hope to be in the BFA digital media art 

program.

Thanks,
Kevin</p>
